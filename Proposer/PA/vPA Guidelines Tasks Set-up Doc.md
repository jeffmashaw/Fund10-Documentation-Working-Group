# Proposer/PA/vPA Guidelines Tasks Set-up Doc
*Pre Fund 10, started 2022-10-04*
## Task Guidance
*See Sub-Circle Working Group Process Doc: https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/community-governance-oversight/circle-problem-sensing/circle-problem-sensing/circle-oversight-working-group*
## Problem Statement Rubric
1. ### Identify (What Problem Do We See?) 
    One strength of the Project Catalyst Community is there are many passionate and talented individuals with suggestions for improving the four core process documents (Proposer Guide, Challenge Team Guide, Proposal Assessor, and Veteran Proposer Assessor). These suggestions exist across a large collection of documents and conversations from editable Google Docs, to Telegram, to DeWork, and Discord among many other. There are also copies of current and former documents existing across many project catalyst sites such as IdeaScale, ProjectCatalyst.org, CardanoCataly.st. and others. This is decentralization at work! 
    
    However, a problematic side effect of this in our current context is confusion and uncertainty for many who desire to see the process improved. This confusion stems from questions about where and how to contribute ideas and effort. There is right now no single, comprehensive system or method for helping to improve the Project Catalyst Core Documents. 
2. ### Rank in Catalyst Context (Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?)
    Solving this problem in a way that remains decentralized and also organized...(cont... here)  
3. ### Solution Articulation (Describe the gap between the current state and the envisioned state?)
    Words
4. ### Define Metrics (How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured?)
    Words
 


### Mission
* To collate and implement community suggestions for improving Proposer, PA, and vPA Guides
* To standardize the Project Catalyst Documentation (Proposer Guide, PA Guide, and VPA Guide) for Fund 10 across all info channels
* To provide consistent objectives for proposals across all three stages (Proposer, PA, and vPA)
### Goals
* Define tasks and deadlines of tasks that need to be done. (1 wk or less)
* Find tasks from TODO and Community
* Create them as subtasks in DeWork and in this/or a master Document
    * Assign each task a priority
    * Assign each task an estimated # of hours to completion
    * Assign each task a due date/deadline
*  A documentation portal
